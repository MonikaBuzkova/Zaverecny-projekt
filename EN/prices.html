    you think that you are going to be unable to attend your appointment, I
    would appreciate if you can give me as much notice as possible. I’ll be
    pleased to cancel and reschedule your appointment at any time, without any
    penalty up to 7 hours before your booking. Any cancellation less than 7
    hours, the full price will be charged. All deposits are non-refundable.
