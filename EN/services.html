      <h2>Supporting pregnancy with prenatal & birth massage</h2>
      <p>I provide support to women during pregnancy and during childbirth.</p>
      <p>
        I can not only treat pregnant women with a relaxing massage
        concentrating on back, belly and feet aches, but I can also teach your
        partner to provide you with a massage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most comfortable position for expectant mothers is sideline
        positioning with supportive, soft cushions used to alleviate the extra
        strain on the lower back and pelvic areas when the pressure of massage
        techniques are applied.

        <h2>Deep tissue</h2>
        <p>
          Deep tissue massage is suitable for all people with problems with
          mustles of the whole body.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most common reasons for people to have a deep tissue
          massage is the general aches and pains that fall under the broad
          definition of rheumatic pains, aching joints and muscle spasms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main underlying cause of many symptoms manifested in the body is
          stress.

        <h2>India head massage</h2>
        <p>
          It is a great stress buster, and although we call it a head massage,
          we incorporate the back, shoulders and arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This treatment is good for corporate clients as it is non-invasive and
          you do not need to remove any clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The physical benefits that can be gained: Ease tight muscles, releases
          shoulders, therefore improving posture.

        <h2>Manual lymphatic drainage</h2>
        <p>
          This massage is based on Dr. Vodder techniques. Lymphatic drainage
          massages can benefit people with lymphedema, fibromyalgia, and other
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a form of gentle massage that encourages the movement of lymph
          fluids around the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fluid in the lymphatic system helps remove waste and toxins from
          the bodily tissues.
