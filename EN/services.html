        <h2>Manual lymphatic drainage</h2>
        <p>This massage is based on Dr. Vodder techniques. Lymphatic drainage massages can benefit people with lymphedema, fibromyalgia, and other conditions.</p>
        <p>It is a form of gentle massage that encourages the movement of lymph fluids around the body.</p>
        <p>The fluid in the lymphatic system helps remove waste and toxins from the bodily tissues.</p>

        <h2>Prenatal and childbirth massage</h2>
        <p>I provide support to women during pregnancy and during childbirth.</p>
        <p>I can not only treat pregnant women with a relaxing massage concentrating on back, belly and feet aches, but I can also teach your partner to provide you with a massage.</p>
        <p>The most comfortable position for expectant mothers is sideline positioning with supportive, soft cushions used to alleviate the extra strain on the lower back and pelvic areas when the pressure of massage techniques are applied.</p>
