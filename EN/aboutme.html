      Hi. I am Jara, a mobile massage therapist (Diploma ITEC, BTEC) based in
      London. Furthermore, I am a member of the FHT Assossiation (Federation of
      Holistic Therapists) and CNHC (Complementary and Natural Healthcare
      Council)

    <p>
      My background is in healthcare. I have practiced complementary therapy for
      9 years, building experiences by working with mobile massage agencies,
      spas, charities as well as in elderly units. My background is in
      healthcare.

      It is my passion to support clients of different ages with a variety of
      challenges, without excluding anybody.
