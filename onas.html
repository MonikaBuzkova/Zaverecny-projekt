      My background is in healthcare. I have practiced complementary therapy for 9 years, building experiences by working with mobile massage agencies, spas, charities as well as in elderly units.

      It is my passion to support clients of different ages with a variety of challenges, without excluding anybody.

    From time to time, I offer my skills to charities on sport events like London Marathon, Pink Rainbow, 10km British Run.
